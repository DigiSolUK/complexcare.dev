// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables, I will assume the code uses some kind of testing framework (like Jest or Mocha) and that the missing variables are part of that framework.  I will add a comment indicating that these are likely part of a testing framework and should be properly imported or declared if they are not already.  Without the original code, this is the best I can do.

// Assuming 'it', 'is', 'correct', and 'and' are part of a testing framework like Jest or Mocha.
// Ensure the testing framework is properly configured and these variables are available in the scope.

// Example of how they might be used (this is just a placeholder, adapt to your actual code):

// it('should do something', () => {
//   expect(something).is.correct.and.somethingElse;
// });

// Similarly for 'brevity', if it's a custom function or variable, it needs to be defined or imported.
// Example:
// const brevity = (input: string) => input.substring(0, 10);

// The rest of the original code would go here, making use of these (now assumed to be) defined variables.
