// Since the existing code was omitted and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// I will assume the variables are used within a testing context (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// I will add a comment indicating that these variables are expected to be globally
// available in the testing environment.  If they are not, the appropriate import
// or declaration should be added based on the specific testing framework used.

// Example:

// components/patients/patient-view-dialog.tsx

// ... (rest of the original code) ...

// NOTE: The following variables (brevity, it, is, correct, and and) are assumed to be
// globally available within the testing environment (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
// If they are not, please import or declare them appropriately for your testing framework.

// ... (rest of the original code) ...
